# Cypress BÃ¡sico Udemy

Sample project for the basic course of the Talking About Testing.

## Pre-requirements

It is required to have Node.js and npm installed to run this project.

> I used versions `v20.11.1' and `13.11.0` of Node.js and Cypress, respectively.

## Installation

Run `npm install` (or `npm i` for the short version) to install the dev dependencies.

## Tests

Run `npm test` (or `npm t` for the short version) to run the test in headless mode.

Or, run `npm run cy:open` to open Cypress in interactive mode.
